    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar in a bowl until evenly combined.
            Press the mixture into the bottom of a springform pan (9 inches/23 cm) to form an even crust.
            Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set it aside to cool.</li>
        <li>eat the softened cream cheese and sugar in a bowl until smooth and creamy.
            Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
            Mix in the vanilla extract, sour cream, and heavy cream until fully incorporated.
            Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Combine blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat.
            Cook until the blueberries release their juices and the mixture starts to bubble.
            Stir in the cornstarch-water mixture and simmer until thickened, about 2–3 minutes.
            Let the topping cool completely before spreading it over the chilled cheesecake.
