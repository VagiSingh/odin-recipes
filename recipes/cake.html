    <h2>About the cake</h2>
    <p>This homemade chocolate cake recipe is super easy to prepare in one bowl for a deliciously moist and fluffy chocolate cake. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had!
        Skip the store-bought mix and make this one-bowl chocolate cake from scratch. It's almost as easy as the boxed stuff, but it's so much more delicious. The Allrecipes community agrees: You don't want to miss this simple chocolate cake recipe.
